## Running Median Work (HW50)

## Plan for Implementation/ Workflow
- We started off by writing ALHeapMax. This required some changes to the conditional statements in our adding and removing methods. ALHeapMax was tested to make sure that it preserved maxheap properties (ie. parents> children)
- Next, we began work on RunMed to implement the efficient running median algorithm discussed in class (algo specified in block comment). We first traced the algorithm for some random values on paper to get a feel for what we were doing.
- Since this algorithm called for two heaps, the constructor must instantiate a new min and max heap.
- add() analyzes the input value and decides which heap to send the input to.
- this group implemented a balance() method for the sake of cleaner code and called it in the add() method.
- getMedian() was completed last and it returns a double median value after comparing the sizes of the two heaps.
- driver file was slightly altered, changing the median value from an int to a double for increased accuracy.
- lastly, input.nums was tested with provided driver file and testing proved successful 



## ALHeap.java work (HW49)
## Runtimes 
- isEmpty checks the size of the AL, so its runtime is constant.
- add has a constant runtime â€” it adds to the end of the AL.
- peekMin has a O(1) runtime - gets the first element of the minheap each time
- removeMin has a O(n^2) runtime - it cycles through the queue to find the minimum (O(n) operation), and then calls AL's remove method (which has a O(n) amortized runtime).

## Priorities and Plan (ie heap todo)
- First priority is to implement the default constructor and to override the toString method so that we can initialize and visualize a created heap.
- Next steps would be to complete the isEmpty(), add(), and peekMin() methods. Add() is essential to subsequent methods.
- Following that, the next level in priority are the removeMin() and minChildPos() methods. minChildPos() is a helper function for removeMin() and the two should be completed together. 

## Here is the workflow/logic that we followed to implement each method for ALHeap.java (#2)
- The constructor was merely an initialization of an ArrayList with Integer objects.
- The toString() printed out a level-order traversal of the tree (ie. printed out elements of _heap one by one).
- For isEmpty() this group decided to use the size() method available for ArrayLists.
- peekMin() took advantage of the fact that the minimum value in a minheap is at index 0.
- add() was a little more complicated. In order to complete this method, the group had to recall that the poistion of the left child is 2(parent's index)+1 and 2(parent's index)+2. Each added value had to be compared with its parents and was swapped upwards until minheap properties satisfied.
- removeMin() relied heavily on minChildPos() and thus, minChildPos() had to be implemented first.
- the thinking and working was shared equally among team members.


## Side Note 
- You might notice that there are four contributors for this repository. This is because AK was operating on her father's account so just so you know, there's nothing funky going on. Everything is under control.
